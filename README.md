# RoboticInference

1) Using the supplied data in the digits image, create a network that achieves at least 75 percent accuracy and an inference time of less than 10 ms. This can be done by running the evaluate command. Be sure to take a screenshot of the results and add the date and your name to the image.

2) Determine what you want your robotic inference idea to be. Collect your own data that fits with what your model is trying to accomplish. Train a network that produces meaningful results.
