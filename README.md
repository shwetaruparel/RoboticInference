# RoboticInference

Project on Robotic Inference using NVidia DIGITS on Udacity Workspace.

Refer the **https://github.com/shwetaruparel/RoboticInference/blob/master/RoboticInference.pdf** for full details of the project.The project include the following -

1)Trained Model for the supplied Dataset. Analysis and comparison of models used. Evaluate command used to find out the inference time and accuracy.

2)Trained model for the collected dataset. Analsysis and comparison of models used.

The python script **objectIm.py** can be used to take pictures can be used with laptops with intergrated camera/webcam connected to laptop.

The collected Dataset can be found at **https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16imt1Vijf3J2q4DVb-Whrmw29fyJp1Cu?usp=sharing**
